## üìÑ Abstract

*FLUX.1* is a diffusion-based text-to-image generation model developed by Black Forest Labs, designed to achieve faithful text-image alignment while maintaining high image quality and diversity. FLUX is considered state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation, outperforming popular models such as Midjourney, DALL¬∑E 3, Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3), and SDXL. Although publicly available as open source, the authors have not released official technical documentation detailing the model‚Äôs architecture or training setup. This report summarizes an extensive reverse-engineering effort aimed at demystifying FLUX‚Äôs architecture directly from its source code, to support its adoption as a backbone for future research and development. This document is an *unofficial* technical report and is **not published or endorsed by the original developers or their affiliated institutions**

## üìã This blog is organized into three main sections:

- [1. Background](/DemystifyingFlux/background/): provides essential high-level context
- [2. FLUX.1 Architecture](/DemystifyingFlux/flux-architecture/): explores the architecture of FLUX.1 in detail
- [3. Models and Tools](/DemystifyingFlux/models-and-tools/): gives a brief overview of the different models in the FLUX family
