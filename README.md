## Abstract
*FLUX.1* is a diffusion-based text-to-image generation model developed by Black Forest Labs, designed to achieve faithful text-image alignment while maintaining high image quality and diversity. FLUX is considered state-of-the-art in image synthesis, outperforming popular models such as Midjourney, DALL·E 3, Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3), and SDXL. Although publicly available as open source, the authors have not released official technical documentation detailing the model’s architecture or training setup. This report summarizes an extensive reverse-engineering effort aimed at demystifying FLUX’s architecture directly from its source code, to support its adoption as a backbone for future research and development.
